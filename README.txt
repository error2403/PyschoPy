Instruments and Materials
This research employs a word-to-picture matching task designed and presented to participants through PsychoPy. Participants were randomly presented with voice recordings of spoken words in both English and Tagalog, recorded by a bilingual English/Tagalog speaker; all words were recorded by the same English/Tagalog bilingual adult who did not participate in the study otherwise. To create a more typical, realistic listening simulation, audio recordings of each stimuli were layered with -2 dB of white noise. In every trial, the target word was paired with a phonological competitor (minimal pair), which varies in one phoneme specifically targeting sounds that utilize motor movement of the tongue (/t/, /d/) and lip movement (/p/,  /b/), a semantically related image, and an unrelated image. Two tasks were created comprising identical trials with identical words and images. Each task contains words in both English and Tagalog mixed with each other. For each task, the target, or “correct” word, will be one of the words with a single phonological difference. Tasks will include 20 words in Tagalog, split evenly to elicit tongue and lip use, and 10 Tagalog filler words. The inclusion of filler words is to prevent participants from suspecting the nature of the experiment. It will include 30 English words in the same manner, for a total of 60 trials per task. 
To investigate the role of articulation in word recognition, in the experimental condition a device will be used to constrict movement of the lips and tongue. The device was 3-D designed for using TinkerCAD software. Participants will undergo the same task in the control condition while holding the device in their hand to control for influences of motor engagement in other forms, allowing analysis of the influence of constricted lip/tongue movement on word processing in isolation. Because the primary purpose of this experiment is to investigate the role of the motor cortex in auditory comprehension, minimal pairs have been designed to highlight the distinctions in participation performance when utilizing tongue movements and lip movements, versus phonemes where such movements are absent.
Participants self-reported proficiency in both English and Tagalog using the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q) (Marian, Blumenfeld, & Kaushanskaya, 2007). Participants also identified the process of acquisition for each language (e. g., immersion, formal education), and their accent level.

Procedure
The participants began by signing an informed consent containing details of their participation responsibilities and benefits of taking part in the experiment before beginning. Once the consent form was completed, participants were verbally asked about their hand dominance. Participants sat in front of the computer screen and began the first trial of the experiment, either the experimental or the control. The order of completion was counterbalanced to prevent any preconceived notions or bias from the participants. Participants were seated in a chair approximately 51cm (20in) away from the computer with hands relaxed over an image of two hands printed in a letter size paper placed in front of the keyboard . In the experimental condition, the participant placed the restriction device in their mouth. An American quarter was placed on the end of the device to add weight and compel participants to hold the apparatus in their mouth to keep the quarter in place. This ensures that the tongue and the lips were obstructed the same way across all participants. Participants read the word-to-picture matching task instruction on the screen, which included an item example. An audio recording of the acoustic stimuli then played, and participants selected the best corresponding image on the screen. Acoustic stimuli were presented through headphones on an ATSU SLP laboratory computer in a random sequence of trials. Participants were asked to reach for the keyboard with their non-dominant hand, and make a selection after being presented with the acoustic stimuli and the visual stimuli. Keyboard selections were pre-assigned to correspond with images, with the leftmost image aligning with the number 1 on the keyboard, the image immediately to the right being linked to number 2, the one in the middle right associated with number 3, and the furthest right image corresponding to number 4. Participants were asked to reset to their starting position with their hands placed on the handprint template in front of the keyboard, before proceeding. A 2-second interval period was given in between each trial. For the control condition, the procedure followed the same steps as for the experimental condition, but participants were asked to complete the task while using their first dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand instead of the lips/tongue. Participants were given the inhibiting device and were instructed to hold the apparatus between their thumb and pointer finger of their dominant hand. Seven quarters were placed on the end of the device to activate the muscle of the hand. In between the control and the experimental conditions, participants completed the LEAP-Q questionnaire so that researchers could obtain a self-reported language background for each participant. 

Data Analysis
Reaction time and the accuracy of participants in both the experimental (contraction of lips and tongue) and control conditions (contraction of the first dorsal interosseous), in the native (L1) and second language (L2) will be compared. This data was collected and recorded through the PsychoPy software and exported to a spreadsheet.
